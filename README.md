# ESP32-WiFiMon
WiFi Monitor for Ethernet enabled ESP32 Boards

Development takes place on an Olimex ESP32-PoE board.

ESP32-WiFiMon aims to be a small device to externally monitor larger WiFi installations.

* check for preconfigured SSIDs
* check for a set of BSSIDs (WiFi MACs)
* check for channel maps
* monitor RSSI values for further analysis

The project is in a very early stage and thus no definitions have been made for how the data will be transmitted. Also note that this is only one part of a bigger suite of tools to check WiFi KPIs in larger setups.

Currently this is mainly a proof of concept.
